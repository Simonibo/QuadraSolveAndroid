    <string name="helptext2">"What is a quadratic equation?"</string>
    <string name="helptext3">
        "A quadratic equation is an equation of the form \"ax² + bx + c = 0\", where a, b and c are real numbers (like 1, 2.5 or -4.6)."
        "You can enter a, b and c (also called coefficients) on the main page when you open the app."
    </string>
    <string name="helptext4">"What is a solution?"</string>
    <string name="helptext5">
        "A solution is a real or complex number x, such that both sides of the equation are equal to 0."
        "Let's consider the example \"x² - 9 = 0\"."
        "It's quite easy to see that both 3 and -3 solve the equation, because 3² - 9 and (-3)² - 9 are both equal to zero."
        "If we consider another example like \"4x² + 3x - 9\", the equation isn't as easy to solve anymore."
        "But with this app, just enter \"4\" in the field labeled \"a\", \"3\" in the field \"b\" and \"-9\" in the field \"c\" and tap on \"Calculate roots\", and the solutions will show up on the top of the screen below the equation."
    </string>
    <string name="helptext5a">"But what is a complex number?"</string>
    <string name="helptext5b">
        "Because some equations like \"x² + 1 = 0\" don't have any solutions in the real numbers, we invent the so-called imaginary unit \"i\" which has the property i² = -1."
        "Thus, we have created two solutions for this equations (i and -i) which are useful in many scenarios."
